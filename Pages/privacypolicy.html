            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">7. Your Rights and Choices</h5>
            <p>We believe in giving you control over your information. Here are some options and tools you can use:
                <br>

                <span class="fw-bold">Access / Update tools: </span><br>
                These are available in the service, allowing you to access, correct, or remove the information
                associated with your account. If you need help, our customer care team is here to assist you.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Device permissions: </span><br>
                You can manage permissions for device data and notifications on your mobile platform, like location
                services or push notifications.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Uninstall: </span><br>
                Uninstalling an app stops information collection, but it won't close your account. Use the service's
                account closure function for that.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Account closure: </span><br>
                You can close your account through the service.

            <p></p>

            <span class="fw-bolder fs-5">Know Your Privacy Rights:</span><br> Depending on your location, you might have
            these rights:
            <br>

            <span class="fw-bold">Access/know: </span><br>
            Request a copy of your stored information, available in a portable format in certain cases.


            <br>
            <span class="fw-bold">Delete/erase: </span><br>
            Ask us to delete your personal information.

            <br>
            <span class="fw-bold">Correct/rectify/update: </span><br>
            Edit most information on your profile, or contact us to correct it.

            <br>
            <span class="fw-bold">Object/restrict: </span><br>
            Object to or request restrictions on certain processing.
            <p></p>
            For these requests, we might need proof of identity for your protection. We may reject requests that are
            unlawful, invalid, or infringe on rights of others.
            <p></p>

            <span class="fw-bolder fs-5">Note for Indian Residents:</span><br> If you're an Indian resident, you can
            appeal denied privacy requests by contacting us and referencing "Privacy Request Appeal." <br>For further
            concerns, you can reach out to your state's attorney general.<br>

            We don't "sell" or use your personal data for targeted advertising or profiling as defined by applicable law
            in your state, so no opt-out choice is needed.<br>

            You can also contact the relevant data protection authority to lodge a complaint.<br>

            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">8. How Long We Retain Your Information</h5>
            <p>We keep your personal information only as long as needed for legitimate business purposes and as allowed
                by the law. If you stop using our services, closing your account will make your profile invisible to
                others. Inactivity for two years will lead to automatic account closure. After this, your personal data
                is deleted as follows:
            <p></p>

            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">10. Job Candidates, Contractors and Vendor Representatives</h5>
            <p>We handle the personal information of job candidates, contractors, and vendor representatives as part of
                our recruitment, talent management, and management of contractor and vendor services. If you fall under
                these categories at MatchKro, certain relevant terms from this Privacy Policy apply to the processing of
                your personal information. These terms include sections discussing responsible entities, personal
                information transfers, your rights under applicable law, how to contact us, and India-specific
                information.<br>

                For job applicants, the personal information processed may vary based on the job you're applying for.
                This typically includes information from your job application, professional qualifications, background
                details, and references that recruiters or third parties provide. This information aids in the
                recruitment process and may lead to an employment contract.<br>

                For contractors and vendor representatives, we process identification and work-related information
                necessary to manage our relationship with you and your employer. This is essential for performing
                services and for legal purposes such as potential claims. We may share this information with service
                providers assisting in recruitment and technical processing, as well as with Match Group affiliates if
                your relationship involves their employees. We retain your personal information only for the required
                duration for these purposes.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">11. Privacy Policy Changes</h5>
            <p>As we continuously seek innovative ways to assist you in forming meaningful connections, and to ensure
                that our data practices are accurately reflected, this policy may be subject to change over time. Before
                any significant changes come into effect, we will provide you with advance notice so that you have the
                opportunity to review the modifications.
