            <p>At MatchKro, we believe in being clear and open about how we collect and process data about you. This
                page is designed to inform you about our practices regarding cookies and to explain how you can manage
                them. You already know everything there is to know about cookies and just want to adjust your settings.
                No problem. Head to your account settings in the app to adjust your privacy preferences there. Do you
                want to know more about cookies and how we use them?
                Happy to explain! Keep on reading.<br>
                Note: This Cookie Policy does not address how we process your personal information outside of our use of
                cookies. To learn more about how we process your personal information, please read our Privacy Policy,
                here.

            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">What are cookies?</h5>
            <p>Cookies are small text files that are sent to or accessed from your web browser or your device’s memory.
                A cookie typically contains the name of the domain (Internet location) from which the cookie originated,
                the “lifetime” of the cookie (i.e., when it expires), and a randomly generated unique number or similar
                identifier. A cookie may also contain information about your device, such as user settings, browsing
                history, and activities conducted while using our services.</p>

            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">Are there different types of cookies?</h5>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">First-party and third-party cookies</span><br>
                There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are placed on your
                device directly by us. For example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your
                browser’s language preferences and to understand your use of our website better. Third-party cookies are
                placed on your device by our partners and service providers. You can learn more about these partners and
                service providers via our website and in-app consent management tools. For details on these tools, see
                “How can you control cookies?” below.
                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Session and persistent cookies</span><br>
                There are session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies only last until you close your
                browser. We use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our
                website during one single browser session and to help you use our website more efficiently. Persistent
                cookies have a longer lifespan and last beyond the current session. These types of cookies can help you
                quickly sign in to our website again, for analytical purposes and other reasons described below.
            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">What about other tracking technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs?</h5>
            <p>Other technologies such as web beacons (also called pixels, tags, or clear gifs); tracking URLs, or
                software development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes as cookies. Web beacons are tiny graphics
                files that contain a unique identifier, enabling us to recognize when someone has visited our service or
                opened an email we’ve sent them. Tracking URLs are custom-generated links that help us understand where
                the traffic to our web pages comes from. SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function
                like cookies and web beacons. For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as “cookies” in this
                Cookie Policy</p>

            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">What do we use cookies for?</h5>
            <p>Like other providers of online services, we use cookies to provide, secure and improve our
                Services, including remembering your preferences, recognizing you when you visit our
                Website, measuring the success of our marketing campaigns and personalizing and tailoring ads to your
                interests. To achieve these aims, we may also link information from cookies with other personal
                information we hold about you.
                When you use our services, some or all of the following types of cookies may be set on your
                Device.
            </p>

            <p>There are several cookie management options available to you. Please note that changes you make to your
                cookie preferences may result in using our services becoming a less satisfying experience, as they may

                <span class="fw-bold">Browser and device controls</span><br>
                Some web browsers provide settings that allow you to control or reject cookies, or that alert you when a
                cookie is placed on your computer. The procedure for managing cookies is slightly different for each
                Internet browser. You can check the specific steps in your particular browser's help menu.
                You may also be able to reset device identifiers or opt-out from having identifiers collected or
                You are processed by using the appropriate setting on your mobile device. The procedures for managing
                identifiers are slightly different for each device. You can check the specific steps in the help or
                settings menu of your particular device.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Interest-based advertising tools</span><br>
                Advertising companies may participate in self-regulatory programs that allow you to opt out of any
                interest-based ads involving them. For more information on this, you can visit the
                Following sites: Digital Advertising Alliance; Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance; Appchoices.
                Opting out does not mean you will not see advertising – it means you won’t see personalized advertising
                from the companies that participate in these opt-out programs. Also, if you delete cookies on your
                device after you’ve opted out, you will need to opt-out again.
