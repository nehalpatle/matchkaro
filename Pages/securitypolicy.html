            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">Safety, Reporting & FAQ’s</h5>
            <p></p>
            <p>
                <span class="fw-bolder fs-5">Communicating and Obtaining Consent</span><br>
                At Matcher, we emphasize the importance of understanding and obtaining consent. We believe that
                relationships should be built on respect and open communication, where all parties mutually agree
                without any pressure, guilt, or coercion. In collaboration with safety experts and advocates, we have
                compiled tips on how to navigate obtaining consent and setting personal boundaries both on and off
                MatchKro.
                <br>

                <span class="fw-bold">Consent is Hot: </span><br>
                Clearly defining what behaviors are comfortable and acceptable, as well as recognizing what crosses
                personal boundaries, contributes to a more enjoyable and respectful dating experience.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">It’s your journey. Be you: </span><br>
                Every individual has unique preferences and dislikes. Effective communication is vital when getting to
                know someone, allowing you to understand their comfort zones.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Feel Empowered: </span><br>
                Consistently checking in about intimate interactions, both online and in person, empowers individuals to
                express their feelings and preferences. This ensures that everyone feels confident saying yes or no.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Respect Boundaries: </span><br>
                If someone declines or sets a boundary, it's important to understand and respect their decision.
                Accepting their choice demonstrates your respect for their feelings.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Always Trust Your Gut: </span><br>
                Never feel pressured to agree to something that doesn't align with your comfort level.

                <br>

            <p></p>

            <span class="fw-bolder fs-5">How Communication Establishes Personal Boundaries</span><br> Always ask for
            preferences using clear language to avoid misunderstandings. Asking questions like, "Are you comfortable
            discussing your sexual preferences? I'd like to know more about what matters to you," allows for open and
            respectful dialogue.
            <br>
            Setting boundaries and adhering to them is perfectly acceptable. Show support for those setting boundaries
            and respond to a "no" with understanding.


            <p></p>

            <span class="fw-bolder fs-5">Not in the Mood? Make It Known</span><br> People's moods change, so it's
            crucial to regularly communicate about intimate interactions, whether online or in person. A "yes" on one
            occasion doesn't guarantee the same response every time. If you or your partner change your mind,
            communicate it openly and respectfully. For instance, you can say, "I'm beginning to feel uncomfortable and
            would like to change the topic." If someone expresses discomfort, show understanding and support by
            responding with, "That's okay!"<br>

            Understanding your partner's preferences contributes to safer and more enjoyable communication.<br>

            Remember, creating a respectful and enjoyable dating experience relies on consent, clear communication, and
            a mutual understanding of personal boundaries.

            <p>

                <span class="fw-bold">Prioritize Safety: </span><br>
                At MatchKro, we prioritize the safety of our users. We want our daters to feel comfortable being
                themselves, matching with others, and planning dates that suit them. We're committed to developing
                tools, features, and resources that keep our users informed and feeling secure. Our resources will be
                user-friendly, clear, and easy to access, aimed at ensuring the safety of our community and empowering
                users to report any threats.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Err on the Side of Caution: </span><br>
                Swift action is essential for creating a safe dating environment. When alerted, we will take immediate
                action to protect MatchKro Daters. We consider all relevant information when making decisions and may
                request additional details to better understand and resolve issues. Your report remains confidential,
                and we never disclose it to the reported person.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Check our Biases: </span><br>
                Our policies and tools will be reviewed regularly to ensure they reflect the evolving social
                environment. We are committed to fostering an inclusive community where authenticity, courage, and
                empathy thrive. Our focus is on maintaining a secure and respectful MatchKro Community.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Not act as arbiters of truth: </span><br>
                We provide information about potential matches, allowing users to connect with those who share their
                beliefs. We're not here to determine what's fact or fiction, but we do ensure users don't put others at
                risk or harm.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Listen: </span><br>
                If a MatchKro Dater reaches out for support, they can expect a response from our team. We value feedback
                and suggestions for improving the app. If you need resources or assistance, we're here to help,
                including connecting you to trained specialists. If you're banned and suspect retaliation or false
                reporting, you can appeal.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Foster A Community Built on Trust & Respect: </span><br>
                We hold the responsibility of creating a safe space for people to form meaningful relationships. We
                respect users' personal information and use it ethically in building our tools and services. We maintain
                the confidentiality of accounts except when communicating with the account owner.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Step in When Necessary: </span><br>
                We intervene when there's a risk of physical, emotional, or psychological harm to a member. We
                collaborate with law enforcement as required and address valid law enforcement requests. We take suicide
                and self-injury seriously and provide support to members in crisis.

                <br>

            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">Expectations for the MatchKro Community:</h5>
            <p></p>
            <p>

                <span class="fw-bold">Be Open to Others: </span><br>
                Our community embraces diversity and inclusivity. You may encounter differing opinions, and we encourage
                you to respect others' viewpoints. Engaging with others in a respectful manner aligns with our values of
                empathy and kindness.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Understand Consent is Critical: </span><br>
                Clear and freely communicated consent is essential. It can be expressed, revoked, or implied. In
                Discover, members are expected to avoid promoting abuse, harm, harassment, hate, or discrimination.
                Offensive content or initiating inappropriate conversations is not acceptable behavior.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Respect Boundaries: </span><br>
                Interacting with other users outside MatchKro should only occur when appropriate and communicated.
                MatchKro interactions should not extend to social media without consent. Respecting someone's decision
                to unmatch means refraining from reaching out through other platforms.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Be Honest: </span><br>
                While surnames are optional, providing false information or using misleading photos goes against our
                honesty and authenticity values. Creating multiple accounts or pretending to be a different age is
                discouraged. Profiles should authentically represent your personality and interests.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Put in Effort: </span><br>
                Invest in your dating life by showcasing your true self. Authenticity and effort lead to meaningful
                connections. Profiles should provide a holistic view of your personality, while respectful and authentic
                communication enhances the Discover experience.

                <br>
                <span class="fw-bold">Seek Meaningful Relation: </span><br>
                MatchKro Daters are seeking genuine connections. Represent yourself authentically, communicate
                transparently, and treat others respectfully. We respect diverse relationship styles, provided they're
                honest and empathetic.

                <br><br>
                At MatchKro, we're committed to fostering a community where safety, respect, and meaningful connections
                flourish. By adhering to these principles and expectations, we create a positive and secure environment
                for all users.
