                Dating Advice. It's important to carefully read this Agreement and the associated policies before
                creating an account. Please review the Dispute Resolution provisions carefully, as they outline how
                claims will be addressed between you and MatchKro. These provisions include a pre-arbitration informal
                dispute resolution process, an arbitration agreement, a small claims court election, a class action
                waiver, additional procedures for mass arbitration filings, and a jury trial waiver that impact your
                rights. Arbitration generally involves less discovery and appellate review compared to court

                are agreeing to and bound by this Agreement. This Agreement applies to all users, regardless of
                registration or subscription status.<br>

                Your use of our Services is also subject to the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Member Principles, and

                reference. If you do not want to be bound by this Agreement, refrain from accessing or using our
                Services.<br>

                We retain the right to modify, amend, or change the Terms at any time. Notice of any significant changes

            <p></p>
            Our App includes ads, as is common in subscription-based services. You may encounter advertisements and
            promotions from third parties, as well as links to external websites or resources. Additionally,
            non-commercial links or references to third parties may be present in our content. Please note that MatchKro

            </p>

            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5>
            <p></p>
            MatchKro's liability is subject to legal limitations.<br>

            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, MatchKro, its affiliates, employees, licensors, and
            service providers shall not be liable for indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, punitive,
            fixed, or enhanced damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other
            intangible losses. This includes damages incurred directly or indirectly due to (i) your access to or use of
            the Services, (ii) the behavior or content of users or third parties in connection with the Services, or
            (iii) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your content, even if MatchKro was advised of the
            possibility of such damages. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, MatchKro's aggregate
            liability to you for all claims related to the Services shall not exceed the amount you paid, if any, to
            MatchKro for the Services during the twenty-four (24) months preceding your first legal action against
            MatchKro.<br>

            The limitations of liability stated above apply irrespective of the grounds for liability (whether default,
            contract, tort, statute, or otherwise), the type of breach, and the events or circumstances giving rise to
            the claim. These limitations shall apply even if your remedies under this agreement do not achieve their
            intended purpose. It's important to note that these limitations of liability might not apply to you if your
            jurisdiction's laws do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages.
            <br>
            Please refer to the full terms and conditions for more detailed information.

            <p></p>
            Indian law and the Federal Arbitration Act will apply to any Dispute (except where prohibited by law). To

            in the appropriate jurisdiction in India (except for claims filed in small claims court, or for users
            residing in a jurisdiction where prohibited by law). Except where prohibited by law, any claims arising out
            of or relating to this Agreement, our Services, or your relationship with MatchKro that for whatever reason
            are not required to be arbitrated or filed in small claims court, will be litigated exclusively in the
            appropriate federal or state courts in India. You and MatchKro consent to the exercise of personal
            jurisdiction of courts in India and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.

            following: (i) adherence to these Terms, which may undergo modifications periodically, (ii) compliance with
            our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Member Principles, and Safety Dating Advice, and (iii) agreement to any

            <h5 class="mt-4 fw-bolder fs-4">18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h5>
            <p></p>

            you and MatchKro concerning the utilization of our Services is encapsulated within these Terms, inclusive of
            the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Member Principles, and Safety Dating Advice, as well as any Additional
            Terms Upon Purchase. These Terms render null and void all preceding agreements, representations, and

            within these Terms is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain fully
            effective. The omission of MatchKro to enforce any right or provision stipulated within these Terms does not
            equate to a waiver of said right or provision. You acknowledge that your MatchKro account is
            non-transferable, and your entitlements to your account and its content terminate upon your demise unless
            legal provisions dictate otherwise. While rights and licenses granted herein cannot be transferred or
            assigned by you, they may be transferred by us without limitations. These Terms do not establish an agency,
            partnership, joint venture, fiduciary relationship, employment arrangement, or any distinct association, and
            you are not authorized to represent or bind MatchKro in any capacity.
